/**
 A <tt>CountingSemaphore(permits_)</tt> is primed with <tt>permits_</tt> virtual tokens.
 A call of <code>acquire</code> removes a token from the semaphore, providing
 there is at least one left; otherwise it suspends the process that
 invoked <code>acquire</code> until a token is available. 
 A call of <code>release</code> releases a token. 
 A call of <code>forceAcquires</code> releases all waiting <code>acquire</code>s,
 and sets the <code>forced</code> flag. A semaphore can be forced at most once.
