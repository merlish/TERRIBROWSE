/**
        This module provides the simplest possible implementation of
        adapters that can be used to transform an ordinary buffer Into
        a ``heartbeat'' buffer. The receiving end of such a buffer is
        capable of discovering that the sending end is no Longer (capable
        of being) in contact with it.
        <p>
        The method is simple: the transmitting end guarantees to send
        something along the channel periodically: either a ``ping''
        message or a message containing real data. If the receiving
        end doesn't receive anything for (slightly more than) one period,
        then it decides that the sending end has ''gone down''.
