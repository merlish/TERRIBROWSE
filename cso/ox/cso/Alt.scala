/**
    An <tt>Alt</tt> is a function-like object constructed from a sequence of guarded
    <tt>Alt.Event</tt>s (of which the most familiar kind are <tt>InPort.Event</tt>s); 
    for example:     
    <pre>
    val f =  new Alt ( List(event1, ... , eventN) )
    </pre> 
    
    An <tt>InPort.Event</tt> usually takes one of the forms: 
    <pre>
       inport (guard)     ==> { bv => cmd }     
       (guard &amp;&amp;&amp; inport) ==> { bv => cmd } 
       inport             ==> { bv => cmd }
    </pre>
    
    (in the third form the guard is implicitly <tt>true</tt>.)
    <p>
    Whenever the guard is true <i>and the port is open</i>, the
    event is said to be enabled. When the port of an enabled event
    is ready to read, the event is said to be ready.  We <i>fire</i>
    an event by evaluating the expression <code>{ bv => cmd
    }(inport?)</code>: <i>i.e.</i> we read a value from the port, then
    apply the function <code>{ bv => cmd }</code> to that value.
    
    <p>
    Additional <code>InPort.Event</code>s take the form:
    <pre>
       inport (guard)     ==>> { bv => cmd }    
       (guard &amp;&amp;&amp; inport) ==>> { bv => cmd } 
       inport             ==>> { bv => cmd }
    </pre>
    
    (in the third form the guard is implicitly <tt>true</tt>.)
    <p>
    We <i>fire</i>
    such events by evaluating the expression <code>(inport?{ bv => cmd })</code>:
    <i>i.e.</i> we perform an extended rendezvous with the port.
    
    <p>
    <b>[Primitive notation]</b>
    The above forms are syntactic sugar for various commands built using
    the following more primitive notation, in which the <code>command</code>
    is required to read from the <code>inport</code>.
    <pre>
       inport (guard)     -?-> { command } 
       (guard &amp;&amp;&amp; inport) -?-> { command } 
       inport             -?-> { command }
    </pre>    
    <p>
    <b>[Pseudo-events]</b>
    There are also two forms of ''pseudo-event'', namely:
    <pre>
       after(expression) ==> { cmd } 
       orelse            ==> { cmd }
    </pre> 
    (no more than one of these may appear).
    
    <p>  
    When <tt>f: Alt</tt> is applied, as <tt>f()</tt>, the guards are first
    evaluated (in the case of an after guard, the Long-valued expression
    is evaluated and determines a timeout in milliseconds). 
    If any of the enabled events is ready, then one of them
    is chosen (nondeterministically), and the event is fired.  [See Note 1]
    
    <p>
    If no enabled event is ready, then the current thread/process
    is suspended until one becomes ready.
    
    <p>
    If no event is enabled, or if they all become disabled while
    the thread is suspended [See Note 2], then an <code>Abort</code> <code>Stop</code>
    exception is thrown (unless the <code>Alt</code> has an
    <code>orelse</code> event associated with it, in which case
    that event's command is executed.
    
    <p>
    If a timeout event is specified (with an <code>after(expression)==>{
    cmd } </code>) guard, and the timeout elapses before any other
    event becomes ready, then the timeout command is executed.
    
    <p>
    <b>[OutPort Events]</b>
    Although they do not appear in classical <b>occam</b>, CSO also implements
    output port events which can also participate in <tt>Alt</tt>s.
    See the documentation of <tt>OutPort</tt> for details.
    
    <p>
    <b>[Restrictions]</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Guards must be side-effect free; as must the timeout 
          specification expression in an <code>after</code> event.</li>
      <li>No  more than one <code>after</code> event may appear.</li>
      <li>No  more than one <code>orelse</code> event may appear.</li>
      <li>A channel's input and output
          ports may not both simultaneously 
          participate in <tt>Alt<tt>s.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    <b>[Note 1]</b> This implementation is ''fair'' inasmuch as
    successive applications of the same <code>Alt</code> object in
    which the same collection of events turn out to be ready result
    in distinct events being fired.
    
    The algorithm used is adapted from the algorithm in the
    paper: <i>The meaning and implementation of PRI ALT in
    <b>occam</b></i>, by Geoff Barrett, Michael Goldsmith, Geraint
    Jones, and Andrew Kay (1988).  This paper can be found at:
           <a href="ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Documents/techpapers/Geraint.Jones/OCCAM-1-88.ps.Z">
              <code>ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Documents/techpapers/Geraint.Jones/OCCAM-1-88.ps.Z</code>
           </a>
    <p> 
    The adaptation adds timeouts. ''Fairness'' is impolemented in a non priority
    alt by starting the scan for a ready port just after the most recently-selected
    port.
    
    <p>
    <b>[Note 2]</b> The only way an <code>InPort.Event</code> can
    become disabled during an alt's wait is by the closure of its port.
