/**
        An analogue of NetIO that uses Datagrams as transport. 
        Connections are still bidirectional, but they are not
        considered to be streamed. Messages between the
        same pair of sockets may overtake each other. Messages may
        also be dropped.
        <p>
        The Server object returned from clientConnection is used
        to send a Client's ''requests'' to a server; the same Server
        object is used to read the server's ''replies.''
        <p>
        The Client objects returned from serverConnection provide
        clients' requests together with the addresses that they
        came from; they accept replies that are annotated with
        the addresses to which they should be sent.
        <p>
        The following is an extract from a very simple client that stops
        when the server it is connected to sends it a zero. 
<pre><code>
   val server = Datagram.clientConnection[int,int](length, host, port)
   val n      = 10
   repeat (n!=0)
   { server ! n
     server ? { case m => n=m }
   }
</code></pre>
        <p>
        The following is an extract from a very simple server, that subtracts 1 from 
        each number
        it is sent, and returns the result to the client that sent it.
<pre><code>
   val clients = Datagram.serverConnection[int,int](length, port)
   repeat  
   { client ? match
             { case (n, theClient)  => client!(n-1, theClient)  }
   }
   client.close
</code></pre>
