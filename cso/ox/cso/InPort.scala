/**
 An <code>InPort[T]</code> is one of the endpoints of a
 channel that transmits values of type <code>T</code>. Its
 principal method is <code>?</code> (sometimes written
 <code>read</code>.
 <p>
 If <code>p</code> is an <code>InPort[T]</code>, and <code>cont</code> 
 denotes a function of type <code>T=>Unit</code> then
 <code>p(guard)==>cont</code> and <code>p==>cont</code>
 yield <code>InPort.Event</code>s for use in an
 <code>Alt</code>.

 Firing such an event results in the execution of
 the command: <code>cont(p?)</code> (the function is applied to
 the next value read from the port).
 <p>
 Events of the form 
 <code>p(guard)==>>cont</code> and
 <code>p==>>cont</code> may also be used in an <code>Alt</code>.
 
 Firing such an event results in the execution of
 the command: <code>p?cont</code> (the function is applied to
 the next value read from the port in an <i>extended rendezvous</i>).
 <p>
 The peer process whose output fired the event is
 synchronized with the end of the evaluation of the command.
